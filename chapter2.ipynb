    "third, Python leaves your code for a moment and jumps into the function you want to invoke; of course, it takes your argument(s) too and passes it/them to the function;\n",
    "fourth, the function executes its code, causes the desired effect (if any), evaluates the desired result(s) (if any) and finishes its task;\n",

    "2.1.14 SECTION SUMMARY\n",
    "1. The print() function is a built-in function. It prints/outputs a specified message to the screen/console window.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Built-in functions, contrary to user-defined functions, are always available and don't have to be imported. Python 3.8 comes with 69 built-in functions. You can find their full list provided in alphabetical order in the Python Standard Library.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To call a function (this process is known as function invocation or function call), you need to use the function name followed by parentheses. You can pass arguments into a function by placing them inside the parentheses. You must separate arguments with a comma, e.g., print(\"Hello,\", \"world!\"). An \"empty\" print() function outputs an empty line to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Python strings are delimited with quotes, e.g., \"I am a string\" (double quotes), or 'I am a string, too' (single quotes).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Computer programs are collections of instructions. An instruction is a command to perform a specific task when executed, e.g., to print a certain message to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see what you've learned today.\n",
    "6. In Python strings the backslash (\\) is a special character which announces that the next character has a different meaning, e.g., \\n (the newline character) starts a new output line.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Positional arguments are the ones whose meaning is dictated by their position, e.g., the second argument is outputted after the first, the third is outputted after the second, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Keyword arguments are the ones whose meaning is not dictated by their location, but by a special word (keyword) used to identify them.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. The end and sep parameters can be used for formatting the output of the print() function. The sep parameter specifies the separator between the outputted arguments, e.g., print(\"H\", \"E\", \"L\", \"L\", \"O\", sep=\"-\"), whereas the end parameter specifies what to print at the end of the print statement.\n",

    "Take, for example, the number eleven million one hundred eleven thousand one hundred eleven. If you took a pencil in your hand right now, you would write the number like this: 11,111,111, or like this: 11.111.111, or even like this: 11 111 111.\n",

    "5. To encode an apostrophe or a quote inside a string, you can either use the escape character, e.g., 'I\\'m happy.', or open and close the string using an opposite set of symbols to the ones you wish to encode, e.g., \"I'm happy.\" to encode an apostrophe, and 'He said \"Python\", not \"typhoon\"' to encode a (double) quote.\n",

    "1. An expression is a combination of values (or variables, operators, calls to functions ‒ you will learn about them soon) which evaluates to a certain value, e.g., 1 + 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Operators are special symbols or keywords which are able to operate on the values and perform (mathematical) operations, e.g., the * operator multiplies two values: x * y.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Arithmetic operators in Python: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (classic division ‒ always returns a float), % (modulus ‒ divides left operand by right operand and returns the remainder of the operation, e.g., 5 % 2 = 1), ** (exponentiation ‒ left operand raised to the power of right operand, e.g., 2 ** 3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8), // (floor/integer division ‒ returns a number resulting from division, but rounded down to the nearest whole number, e.g., 3 // 2.0 = 1.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A unary operator is an operator with only one operand, e.g., -1, or +3.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. A binary operator is an operator with two operands, e.g., 4 + 5, or 12 % 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Some operators act before others - the hierarchy of priorities:\n",
    "\n",
    "the ** operator (exponentiation) has the highest priority;\n",
    "then the unary + and - (note: a unary operator to the right of the exponentiation operator binds more strongly, for example 4 ** -1 equals 0.25)\n",
    "then: *, /, and %,\n",
    "and finally, the lowest priority: binary + and -.\n",
    "7. Subexpressions in parentheses are always calculated first, e.g., 15 - 1 * (5 * (1 + 2)) = 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The exponentiation operator uses right-sided binding, e.g., 2 ** 2 ** 3 = 256.\n",

    "3. Arithmetic operators in Python: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (classic division ‒ always returns a float), % (modulus ‒ divides left operand by right operand and returns the remainder of the operation, e.g., 5 % 2 = 1), ** (exponentiation ‒ left operand raised to the power of right operand, e.g., 2 ** 3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8), // (floor/integer division ‒ returns a number resulting from division, but rounded down to the nearest whole number, e.g., 3 // 2.0 = 1.0)\n",

    "the name of the variable must begin with a letter;\n",

    "The new function gets data from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "print() has no usable result. The meaning of the new function is to return a very usable result.\n",

    "The function is named input(). The name of the function says everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input() function is able to read data entered by the user and to return the same data to the running program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program can manipulate the data, making the code truly interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtually all programs read and process data. A program which doesn't get a user's input is a deaf program.\n",

    "The program prompts the user to input some data from the console (most likely using a keyboard, although it is also possible to input data using voice or image);\n",
    "the input() function is invoked without arguments (this is the simplest way of using the function); the function will switch the console to input mode; you'll see a blinking cursor, and you'll be able to input some keystrokes, finishing off by hitting the Enter key; all the inputted data will be sent to your program through the function's result;\n",
    "note: you need to assign the result to a variable; this is crucial ‒ missing out this step will cause the entered data to be lost;\n",

    "1. The print() function sends data to the console, while the input() function gets data from the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The input() function comes with an optional parameter: the prompt string. It allows you to write a message before the user input, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n",
    "print(\"Hello, \" + name + \". Nice to meet you!\")\n",
    " \n",
    "3. When the input() function is called, the program's flow is stopped, the prompt symbol keeps blinking (it prompts the user to take action when the console is switched to input mode) until the user has entered an input and/or pressed the Enter key.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Note  \n",
    "You can test the functionality of the input() function in its full scope locally on your machine. For resource optimization reasons, we have limited the maximum program execution time in Edube to a few seconds. Go to the Sandbox, copy-paste the above snippet, run the program, and do nothing ‒ just wait a few seconds to see what happens. Your program should be stopped automatically after a short moment. Now open IDLE, and run the same program there ‒ can you see the difference?\n",
