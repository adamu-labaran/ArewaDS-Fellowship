    "To try the following examples yourself, you can enter these lines in an editor and save the file as pi_digits.txt, or you can download the file from the book’s resources through https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e. Save the file in the same directory where you’ll store this chapter’s programs.Here’s a program that opens this file, reads it, and prints the contents of the file to the screen:\n",

    "1 path = Path('pi_digits.txt')\n",

Python provides a module called pathlib that makes it easier to work with files and directories, no matter which operating system you or your program’s users are working with. A module that provides specific functionality like this is often called a library, hence the name pathlib.We start by importing the Path class from pathlib. There’s a lot you can do with a Path object that points to a file. For example, you can check that the file exists before working with it, read the file’s contents, or write new data to the file. Here, we build a Path object representing the file pi_digits.txt, which we assign to the variable path 1. Since this file is saved in the same \n",

This is important because it tells us what kind of exception to use in the except block that we’ll write.Looking back near the beginning of the traceback 1, we can see that the error occurred at line 4 in the file alice.py. The next line shows the line of code that caused the error 2. The rest of the traceback shows some code from the libraries that are involved in opening and reading from files. You don’t usually need to read through or understand all of these lines in a traceback.To handle the error that’s being raised, the try block will begin with the line that was identified as problematic in the traceback. In our example, this is the line that contains read_text():\n",

    "Analyzing Text\n",
    "You can analyze text files containing entire books. Many classic works of literature are available as simple text files because they are in the pub-lic domain. The texts used in this section come from Project Gutenberg (https://gutenberg.org).

We take the string contents, which now contains the entire text of Alice in Wonderland as one long string, and use split() to produce a list of all the words in the book 1. Using len() on this list 2 gives us a good approximation of the number of words in the original text. Lastly, we print a statement that reports how many words were found in the file. This code is placed in the else block because it only works if the code in the try block was executed successfully.The output tells us how many words are in alice.txt:\n",

It’s a good habit to keep comments up to date when you’re modifying a program, so the comment has also been changed to a docstring and reworded slightly 1.Now we can write a short loop to count the words in any text we want to analyze. We do this by storing the names of the files we want to analyze in a list, and then we call count_words() for each file in the list. We’ll try to count the words for Alice in Wonderland, Siddhartha, Moby Dick, and Little Women,  which are all available in the public domain. I’ve intentionally left siddhartha.txt  out of the directory containing word_count.py, so we can see how well our program handles a missing file:\n",

    "Using the try-except block in this example provides two significant advantages.

    "Siddhartha. It would never analyze Moby Dick or Little Women.\n",
    "Failing Silently\n",
    "In the previous example, we informed our users that one of the files was unavailable. But you don’t need to report every exception you catch. Sometimes, you’ll want the program to fail silently when an exception occurs and continue on as if nothing happened. To make a program fail silently, you write a try block as usual, but you explicitly tell Python to do \n",
    "Files and Exceptions   199\n",

    "    except FileNotFoundError:        pass    else:        --snip--\n",
    "The only difference between this listing and the previous one is the pass statement in the except block. Now when a FileNotFoundError is raised, the code in the except block runs, but nothing happens. No traceback is pro-duced, and there’s no output in response to the error that was raised. Users see the word counts for each file that exists, but they don’t see any indica-tion that a file wasn’t found:\n",
    "The file alice.txt has about 29594 words.The file moby_dick.txt has about 215864 words.The file little_women.txt has about 189142 words.\n",
    "The pass statement also acts as a placeholder. It’s a reminder that you’re choosing to do nothing at a specific point in your program’s execu-tion and that you might want to do something there later. For example, in this program we might decide to write any missing filenames to a file called missing_files.txt. Our users wouldn’t see this file, but we’d be able to read the file and deal with any missing texts.\n",
    "Deciding Which Errors to Report\n",
    "How do you know when to report an error to your users and when to let your program fail silently? If users know which texts are supposed to be analyzed, they might appreciate a message informing them why some texts were not analyzed. If users expect to see some results but don’t know which books are supposed to be analyzed, they might not need to know that some texts were unavailable. Giving users information they aren’t looking for can decrease the usability of your program. Python’s error-handling struc-tures give you fine-grained control over how much to share with users when things go wrong; it’s up to you to decide how much information to share.Well-written, properly tested code is not very prone to internal errors, such as syntax or logical errors. But every time your program depends on something external such as user input, the existence of a file, or the avail-ability of a network connection, there is a possibility of an exception being raised. A little experience will help you know where to include exception-handling blocks in your program and how much to report to users about errors that arise.\n",

    "Many of your programs will ask users to input certain kinds of information. You might allow users to store preferences in a game or provide data for a visu-alization. Whatever the focus of your program is, you’ll store the information users provide in data structures such as lists and dictionaries. When users close a program, you’ll almost always want to save the information they entered. A simple way to do this involves storing your data using the json module.The json module allows you to convert simple Python data structures into JSON-formatted strings, and then load the data from that file the next time the program runs. You can also use json to share data between differ-ent Python programs. Even better, the JSON data format is not specific to Python, so you can share data you store in the JSON format with people who work in many other programming languages. It’s a useful and portable format, and it’s easy to learn.\n",

    "We first import the json module, and then create a list of numbers to work with. Then we choose a filename in which to store the list of num-bers 1. It’s customary to use the file extension .json to indicate that the data in the file is stored in the JSON format. Next, we use the json.dumps() 2 function to generate a string containing the JSON representation of the data we’re working with. Once we have this string, we write it to the file using the same write_text() method we used earlier.This program has no output, but let’s open the file numbers.json and look at it.

Refactoring makes your code cleaner, easier to understand, and easier to extend.We can refactor remember_me.py by moving the bulk of its logic into one or more functions.

    ">>> import dbm\n",
    ">>> db = dbm.open('captions', 'c')\n",
    "The mode 'c'means that the database should be created if it doesn’t already exist. The\n",
    "result is a database object that can be used (for most operations) like a dictionary.\n",
    "When you create a new item, dbm updates the database file.\n",
    ">>> db['cleese.png'] = 'Photo of John Cleese.'\n",
    "When you access one of the items, dbm reads the file:\n",
    ">>> db['cleese.png']\n",
    "b'Photo of John Cleese.'\n",
    "The result is a bytes object, which is why it begins with b. A bytes object is similar to a\n",
    "string in many ways. When you get farther into Python, the difference becomes important,\n",
    "but for now we can ignore it.\n",
    "If you make another assignment to an existing key, dbm replaces the old value:\n",

    "14.7 Pickling\n",
    "A limitation of dbm is that the keys and values have to be strings or bytes. If you try to use\n",
    "any other type, you get an error.\n",
    "The pickle module can help. It translates almost any type of object into a string suitable\n",
    "for storage in a database, and then translates strings back into objects.\n",

    "False\n",

    "and launch a web browser by typing (for example) firefox.\n",
    "Any program that you can launch from the shell can also be launched from Python using\n",
    "a pipe object, which represents a running program.\n",
    "For example, the Unix command ls -l normally displays the contents of the current di-\n",
    "rectory in long format. You can launch ls with os.popen1:\n",
    ">>> cmd = 'ls -l'\n",
    ">>> fp = os.popen(cmd)\n",
    "1 popenis deprecated now, which means we are supposed to stop using it and start using the subprocess\n",

    "popenuntil they take it away.\n",
    "14.9. Writing modules 143\n",
    "The argument is a string that contains a shell command. The return value is an object that\n",
    "behaves like an open file. You can read the output from the ls process one line at a time\n",
    "with readline or get the whole thing at once with read:\n",

    "When you are done, you close the pipe like a file:\n",
    ">>> stat = fp.close()\n",
    ">>> print(stat)\n",
    "None\n",
    "The return value is the final status of the ls process; None means that it ended normally\n",
    "(with no errors).\n",
    "For example, most Unix systems provide a command called md5sum that reads the contents\n",
    "of a file and computes a “checksum”. You can read about MD5 at http://en.wikipedia.\n",
    "org/wiki/Md5. This command provides an efficient way to check whether two files have\n",
    "the same contents. The probability that different contents yield the same checksum is very\n",
    "small (that is, unlikely to happen before the universe collapses).\n",
    "You can use a pipe to run md5sum from Python and get the result:\n",
    ">>> filename = 'book.tex'\n",
    ">>> cmd = 'md5sum '+ filename\n",
    ">>> fp = os.popen(cmd)\n",

    ">>> print(stat)\n",
    "None\n",
    "14.9 Writing modules\n",
    "Any file that contains Python code can be imported as a module. For example, suppose\n",
    "you have a file named wc.py with the following code:\n",
    "def linecount(filename):\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "for line in open(filename):\n",
    "count += 1\n",
    "return count\n",
    "print(linecount('wc.py'))\n",
    "If you run this program, it reads itself and prints the number of lines in the file, which is 7.\n",
    "You can also import it like this:\n",
    ">>> import wc\n",
    "7\n",
    "Now you have a module object wc:\n",
    ">>> wc\n",
    "<module 'wc'from 'wc.py'>\n",
    "144 Chapter 14. Files\n",
    "The module object provides linecount:\n",
    ">>> wc.linecount('wc.py')\n",
    "7\n",
    "So that’s how you write modules in Python.\n",
    "The only problem with this example is that when you import the module it runs the test\n",
    "code at the bottom. Normally when you import a module, it defines new functions but it\n",
    "doesn’t run them.\n",
    "Programs that will be imported as modules often use the following idiom:\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "print(linecount('wc.py'))\n",
    "__name__ is a built-in variable that is set when the program starts. If the program is running\n",
    "as a script, __name__ has the value '__main__'; in that case, the test code runs. Otherwise,\n",
    "if the module is being imported, the test code is skipped.\n",
    "As an exercise, type this example into a file named wc.py and run it as a script. Then run\n",
    "the Python interpreter and import wc. What is the value of __name__ when the module is\n",
    "being imported?\n",
    "Warning: If you import a module that has already been imported, Python does nothing. It\n",
    "does not re-read the file, even if it has changed.\n",
    "If you want to reload a module, you can use the built-in function reload, but it can be\n",
    "tricky, so the safest thing to do is restart the interpreter and then import the module again.\n",
    "14.10 Debugging\n",
    "When you are reading and writing files, you might run into problems with whitespace.\n",
    "These errors can be hard to debug because spaces, tabs and newlines are normally invisible:\n",
    ">>> s = '1 2\\t 3\\n 4'\n",
    ">>> print(s)\n",
    "1 2 3\n",
    "4\n",
    "The built-in function repr can help. It takes any object as an argument and returns a string\n",
    "representation of the object. For strings, it represents whitespace characters with backslash\n",
    "sequences:\n",
    ">>> print(repr(s))\n",
    "'1 2\\t 3\\n 4'\n",
    "This can be helpful for debugging.\n",
    "One other problem you might run into is that different systems use different characters to\n",
    "indicate the end of a line. Some systems use a newline, represented \\n. Others use a return\n",
    "character, represented \\r. Some use both. If you move files between different systems,\n",
    "these inconsistencies can cause problems.\n",

    "Changing Case in a String with Methods\n",
    "One of the simplest tasks you can do with strings is change the case of the words in a string. Look at the following code, and try to determine what’s happening:\n",
    "name.pyname = \"ada lovelace\"print(name.title())\n",
    "Save this file as name.py and then run it. You should see this output:\n",
    "Ada Lovelace\n",
    "In this example, the variable name refers to the lowercase string \"ada lovelace\". The method title() appears after the variable in the print() call. A \n",
    "method is an action that Python can perform on a piece of data. The dot (.) after name in name.title() tells Python to make the title() method act on the variable name. Every method is followed by a set of parentheses, because methods often need additional information to do their work. That informa-tion is provided inside the parentheses. The title() function doesn’t need any additional information, so its parentheses are empty.The title() method changes each word to title case, where each word begins with a capital letter. This is useful because you’ll often want to think of a name as a piece of information. For example, you might want your pro-gram to recognize the input values Ada, ADA, and ada as the same name, and display all of them as Ada.Several other useful methods are available for dealing with case as well. For example, you can change a string to all uppercase or all lowercase let-ters like this:\n",
    "name = \"Ada Lovelace\"print(name.upper())print(name.lower())\n",
    "This will display the following:\n",
    "ADA LOVELACEada lovelace\n",
    "The lower() method is particularly useful for storing data. You typi-cally won’t want to trust the capitalization that your users provide, so you’ll convert strings to lowercase before storing them. Then when you want to display the information, you’ll use the case that makes the most sense for each string.\n",
    "Using Variables in Strings\n",
    "In some situations, you’ll want to use a variable’s value inside a string. For example, you might want to use two variables to represent a first name and \n",
    "Variables and Simple Data Types    21\n",
    "a last name, respectively, and then combine those values to display some-one’s full name:\n",
    "full_name.pyfirst_name = \"ada\"last_name = \"lovelace\"\n",
    "1 full_name = f\"{first_name} {last_name}\"print(full_name)\n",
    "To insert a variable’s value into a string, place the letter f immediately before the opening quotation mark 1. Put braces around the name or names of any variable you want to use inside the string. Python will replace each variable with its value when the string is displayed.These strings are called f-strings. The f is for format, because Python formats the string by replacing the name of any variable in braces with its value. The output from the previous code is:\n",
    "ada lovelace\n",
    "You can do a lot with f-strings. For example, you can use f-strings to compose complete messages using the information associated with a vari-able, as shown here:\n",
    "first_name = \"ada\"last_name = \"lovelace\"full_name = f\"{first_name} {last_name}\"\n",
    "1 print(f\"Hello, {full_name.title()}!\")\n",
    "The full name is used in a sentence that greets the user 1, and the \n",
    "title() method changes the name to title case. This code returns a simple but nicely formatted greeting:\n",
    "Hello, Ada Lovelace!\n",
    "You can also use f-strings to compose a message, and then assign the entire message to a variable:\n",
    "first_name = \"ada\"last_name = \"lovelace\"full_name = f\"{first_name} {last_name}\"\n",
    "1 message = f\"Hello, {full_name.title()}!\"\n",

    "Adding Whitespace to Strings with Tabs or Newlines\n",
    "In programming, whitespace refers to any nonprinting characters, such as spaces, tabs, and end-of-line symbols. You can use whitespace to organize your output so it’s easier for users to read.\n",
    "22   Chapter 2\n",
    "To add a tab to your text, use the character combination \\t:\n",
    ">>> print(\"Python\")\n",
    "Python>>> print(\"\\tPython\")\n",
    "    Python\n",
    "To add a newline in a string, use the character combination \\n:\n",
    ">>> print(\"Languages:\\nPython\\nC\\nJavaScript\")\n",
    "Languages:PythonCJavaScript\n",
    "You can also combine tabs and newlines in a single string. The string \n",
    "\"\\n\\t\" tells Python to move to a new line, and start the next line with a tab. The following example shows how you can use a one-line string to generate four lines of output:\n",
    ">>> print(\"Languages:\\n\\tPython\\n\\tC\\n\\tJavaScript\")\n",
    "Languages:    Python    C    JavaScript\n",
    "Newlines and tabs will be very useful in the next two chapters, when you start to produce many lines of output from just a few lines of code.\n",
    "Stripping Whitespace\n",
    "Extra whitespace can be confusing in your programs. To programmers, \n",
    "'python' and 'python ' look pretty much the same. But to a program, they are two different strings. Python detects the extra space in 'python ' and considers it significant unless you tell it otherwise.It’s important to think about whitespace, because often you’ll want to compare two strings to determine whether they are the same. For example, one important instance might involve checking people’s usernames when they log in to a website. Extra whitespace can be confusing in much sim-pler situations as well. Fortunately, Python makes it easy to eliminate extra whitespace from data that people enter.Python can look for extra whitespace on the right and left sides of a string. To ensure that no whitespace exists at the right side of a string, use the rstrip() method:\n",
    "1 >>> favorite_language = 'python '\n",

For example, if you use an apostrophe within single quotes, you’ll produce an error. This happens because Python inter-prets everything between the first single quote and the apostrophe as a string. It then tries to interpret the rest of the text as Python code, which causes errors.Here’s how to use single and double quotes correctly. Save this program as apostrophe.py and then run it:\n",
    "apostrophe.pymessage = \"One of Python's strengths is its diverse community.\"print(message)\n",
    "The apostrophe appears inside a set of double quotes, so the Python interpreter has no trouble reading the string correctly:\n",

    "In this chapter, you learned how to work with files. You learned to read the entire contents of a file, and then work through the contents one line at a time if you need to. You learned to write as much text as you want to a file. You also read about exceptions and how to handle the exceptions you’re likely to see in your programs. Finally, you learned how to store Python data structures so you can save information your users provide, preventing them from having to start over each time they run a program.In Chapter 11, you’ll learn efficient ways to test your code. This will help you trust that the code you develop is correct, and it will help you identify bugs that are introduced as you continue to build on the programs you’ve written.\n"
