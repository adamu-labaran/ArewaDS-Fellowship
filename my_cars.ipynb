    "___\n",
    "from module_name import *\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    ">This method is not recommended for two reasons. First, it’s helpful to be a ble to read the import statements at the top of a file and get a clear sense of which classes a program uses. With this approach it’s unclear which classes you’re using from the module. This approach can also lead to confusion with names in the file. If you accidentally import a class with the same name as something else in your program file, you can create errors that are hard to diagnose. I show this here because even though it’s not a recommended approach, you’re likely to see it in other people’s code at some point.\n",
    "\n",
    ">If you need to import many classes from a module, you’re better off importing the entire module and using the module_name.ClassName syntax. You won’t see all the classes used at the top of the file, but you’ll see clearly where the module is used in the program. You’ll also avoid the potential naming conflicts that can arise when you import every class in a module.\n",

When you store your classes in several modules, you may find that a class in one module depends on a class in another module.\n",
    "\n",
    ">When this happens, you can import the required class into the first module. For example, let’s store the Car class in one module and the ElectricCar and Battery classes in a separate module. We’ll make a new module called electric_car.py—replacing the electric_car.py file we created earlier—and copy just the Battery and ElectricCar classes into this file:\n",
