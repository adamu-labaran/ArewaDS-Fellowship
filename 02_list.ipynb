    ">In Chapter 3 you learned how to make a simple list, and you learned to work with the individual elements in a list. In this chapter you’ll learn how to loop through an entire list using just a few lines of code, regardless of how long the list is. Looping allows you to take the same action, or set of actions, with every item in a list. As a result, you’ll be able to work efficiently with lists of any length, including those with thousands or even millions of items.\n",

When you want to do the same action with every item in a list, you can use Python’s for loop.Say we have a list of magicians’ names, and we want to print out each name in the list. We could do this by retrieving each name from the list indi-vidually, but this approach could cause several problems. For one, it would be repetitive to do this with a long list of names. Also, we’d have to change our code each time the list’s length changed. Using a for loop avoids both of these issues by letting Python manage these issues internally.Let’s use a for loop to print out each name in a list of magicians:"
