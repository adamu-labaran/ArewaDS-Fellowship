    "if Statements\n",
    "When you understand conditional tests, you can start writing if statements. Several different kinds of if statements exist, and your choice of which to use depends on the number of conditions you need to test. You saw several examples of if statements in the discussion about conditional tests, but now let’s dig deeper into the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple if Statements\n",
    "The simplest kind of if statement has one test and one action:\n",
    "if conditional_test:    do something\n",
    "You can put any conditional test in the first line and just about any action in the indented block following the test. If the conditional test evaluates to \n",
    "True, Python executes the code following the if statement. If the test evaluates to False, Python ignores the code following the if statement.Let’s say we have a variable representing a person’s age, and we want to know if that person is old enough to vote. The following code tests whether the person can vote:\n",
    "voting.py age = 19if age >= 18:    print(\"You are old enough to vote!\")\n",
    "Python checks to see whether the value of age is greater than or equal to 18. It is, so Python executes the indented print() call:\n",
    "You are old enough to vote!\n",
    "\n",
    "Indentation plays the same role in if statements as it did in for loops. All indented lines after an if statement will be executed if the test passes, and the entire block of indented lines will be ignored if the test does not pass.You can have as many lines of code as you want in the block follow-ing the if statement. Let’s add another line of output if the person is old enough to vote, asking if the individual has registered to vote yet:\n",
    "age = 19if age >= 18:    print(\"You are old enough to vote!\")    print(\"Have you registered to vote yet?\")\n",
    "The conditional test passes, and both print() calls are indented, so both lines are printed:\n",
    "You are old enough to vote!Have you registered to vote yet?\n",
    "If the value of age is less than 18, this program would produce no output.\n",
    "if-else Statements\n",
    "Often, you’ll want to take one action when a conditional test passes and a dif-ferent action in all other cases. Python’s if-else syntax makes this possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "An if-else block is similar to a simple if statement, but the else statement allows you to define an action or set of actions that are executed when the condi-tional test fails.We’ll display the same message we had previously if the person is old enough to vote, but this time we’ll add a message for anyone who is not  old enough to vote:\n",
    "age = 17\n",
    "if age >= 18:    \n",
    "print(\"You are old enough to vote!\")    \n",
    "print(\"Have you registered to vote yet?\")\n",
    "else:    \n",
    "print(\"Sorry, you are too young to vote.\")    \n",
    "print(\"Please register to vote as soon as you turn 18!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "If the conditional test 1 passes, the first block of indented print() calls is executed. If the test evaluates to False, the else block 2 is executed. Because age is less than 18 this time, the conditional test fails and the code in the else block is executed:\n",
    "Sorry, you are too young to vote.Please register to vote as soon as you turn 18!\n",
    "This code works because it has only two possible situations to evaluate: a person is either old enough to vote or not old enough to vote. \n",
    "\n",
    "The if-else \n",
    "structure works well in situations in which you want Python to always exe-cute one of two possible actions. In a simple if-else chain like this, one of the two actions will always be executed.\n",
    "The if-elif-else Chain\n",
    "Often, you’ll need to test more than two possible situations, and to evaluate these you can use Python’s if-elif-else syntax. Python executes only one block in an if-elif-else chain. It runs each conditional test in order, until one passes. When a test passes, the code following that test is executed and Python skips the rest of the tests.Many real-world situations involve more than two possible conditions. For example, consider an amusement park that charges different rates for different age groups:\n",
    "• Admission for anyone under age 4 is free.\n",
    "• Admission for anyone between the ages of 4 and 18 is $25.\n",
    "• Admission for anyone age 18 or older is $40.How can we use an if statement to determine a person’s admission rate? The following code tests for the age group of a person and then prints an admission price message:\n",
    "amusement _park.py\n",
    "age = 12\n",
    "if age < 4:    print(\"Your admission cost is $0.\")\n",
    "elif age < 18:    print(\"Your admission cost is $25.\")\n",
    "else:    print(\"Your admission cost is $40.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The if test 1 checks whether a person is under 4 years old. When the test passes, an appropriate message is printed and Python skips the rest of the tests. The elif line 2 is really another if test, which runs only if the previous test failed. At this point in the chain, we know the person is at least 4 years old because the first test failed. If the person is under 18, an appro-priate message is printed and Python skips the else block. If both the if and elif tests fail, Python runs the code in the else block 3.In this example the if test 1 evaluates to False, so its code block is not executed. However, the elif test evaluates to True (12 is less than 18) so its code is executed. The output is one sentence, informing the user of the admission cost:\n",
    "Your admission cost is $25.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any age greater than 17 would cause the first two tests to fail. In these situations, the else block would be executed and the admission price would be $40.Rather than printing the admission price within the if-elif-else block, it would be more concise to set just the price inside the if-elif-else chain  and then have a single print() call that runs after the chain has been evaluated:\n",
    "\n",
    "age = 12\n",
    "if age < 4:    \n",
    "price = 0elif age < 18:    \n",
    "price = 25else:    \n",
    "price = 40\n",
    "print(f\"Your admission cost is ${price}.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The indented lines set the value of price according to the person’s age, as in the previous example. After the price is set by the if-elif-else chain, a separate unindented print() call uses this value to display a message report-ing the person’s admission price.This code produces the same output as the previous example, but the purpose of the if-elif-else chain is narrower. Instead of determining a price and displaying a message, it simply determines the admission price. In addi-tion to being more efficient, this revised code is easier to modify than the original approach. To change the text of the output message, you would need to change only one print() call rather than three separate print() calls."

    "Using Multiple elif Blocks\n",
    "You can use as many elif blocks in your code as you like. For example, if the amusement park were to implement a discount for seniors, you could add one more conditional test to the code to determine whether someone quali-fies for the senior discount. Let’s say that anyone 65 or older pays half the regular admission, or $20:\n",
    "age = 12if age < 4:    price = 0elif age < 18:    price = 25elif age < 65:    price = 40else:    price = 20print(f\"Your admission cost is ${price}.\")\n",
    "Most of this code is unchanged. The second elif block now checks to make sure a person is less than age 65 before assigning them the full admis-sion rate of $40. Notice that the value assigned in the else block needs to be changed to $20, because the only ages that make it to this block are for people 65 or older.\n",
    "82   Chapter 5\n",
    "Omitting the else Block\n",
    "Python does not require an else block at the end of an if-elif chain. Sometimes, an else block is useful. Other times, it’s clearer to use an addi-tional elif statement that catches the specific condition of interest:\n",
    "age = 12if age < 4:    price = 0elif age < 18:    price = 25elif age < 65:    price = 40elif age >= 65:    price = 20print(f\"Your admission cost is ${price}.\")\n",
    "The final elif block assigns a price of $20 when the person is 65 or older, which is a little clearer than the general else block. With this change, every block of code must pass a specific test in order to be executed.The else block is a catchall statement. It matches any condition that wasn’t matched by a specific if or elif test, and that can sometimes include invalid or even malicious data. If you have a specific final condition you’re testing for, consider using a final elif block and omit the else block. As a result, you’ll be more confident that your code will run only under the cor-rect conditions.\n"

    "Testing Multiple Conditions\n",
    "The if-elif-else chain is powerful, but it’s only appropriate to use when you just need one test to pass. As soon as Python finds one test that passes, it skips the rest of the tests. This behavior is beneficial, because it’s efficient and allows you to test for one specific condition.However, sometimes it’s important to check all conditions of interest. In this case, you should use a series of simple if statements with no elif or else blocks. This technique makes sense when more than one condition could be True, and you want to act on every condition that is True.Let’s reconsider the pizzeria example. If someone requests a two-topping pizza, you’ll need to be sure to include both toppings on their pizza:\n",
    "toppings.py requested_toppings = ['mushrooms', 'extra cheese']if 'mushrooms' in requested_toppings:    print(\"Adding mushrooms.\")\n",

    "if Statements   83\n",
    "if 'extra cheese' in requested_toppings:    print(\"Adding extra cheese.\")print(\"\\nFinished making your pizza!\")\n",
    "We start with a list containing the requested toppings. The first if statement checks to see whether the person requested mushrooms on their pizza. If so, a message is printed confirming that topping. The test for pep-peroni 1 is another simple if statement, not an elif or else statement, so this test is run regardless of whether the previous test passed or not. The last if statement checks whether extra cheese was requested, regardless of the results from the first two tests. These three independent tests are exe-cuted every time this program is run.Because every condition in this example is evaluated, both mushrooms and extra cheese are added to the pizza:\n",
    "Adding mushrooms.Adding extra cheese.Finished making your pizza!\n",
    "This code would not work properly if we used an if-elif-else block, because the code would stop running after only one test passes. Here’s what that would look like:\n",
    "requested_toppings = ['mushrooms', 'extra cheese']if 'mushrooms' in requested_toppings:    print(\"Adding mushrooms.\")elif 'pepperoni' in requested_toppings:    print(\"Adding pepperoni.\")elif 'extra cheese' in requested_toppings:    print(\"Adding extra cheese.\")print(\"\\nFinished making your pizza!\")\n",
    "The test for 'mushrooms' is the first test to pass, so mushrooms are added to the pizza. However, the values 'extra cheese' and 'pepperoni' are never checked, because Python doesn’t run any tests beyond the first test that passes in an if-elif-else chain. The customer’s first topping will be added, but all of their other toppings will be missed:\n",
    "Adding mushrooms.Finished making your pizza!\n",
    "In summary, if you want only one block of code to run, use an if-elif-else chain. If more than one block of code needs to run, use a series of indepen-dent if statements.\n",

Now that you have a basic understanding of condi-tional tests and if statements, let’s take a closer look at how you can watch for special values in a list and handle those values appropriately.Let’s continue with the pizzeria example. The pizzeria displays a mes-sage whenever a topping is added to your pizza, as it’s being made. The code for this action can be written very efficiently by making a list of toppings the customer has requested and using a loop to announce each topping as it’s added to the pizza:\n",

Soon we’ll let users provide the information that’s stored in a list, so we won’t be able to assume that a list has any items in it each time a loop is run. In this situation, it’s useful to check whether a list is empty before running a for loop.As an example, let’s check whether the list of requested toppings is empty before building the pizza. If the list is empty, we’ll prompt the user and make sure they want a plain pizza. If the list is not empty, we’ll build the pizza just as we did in the previous examples:\n",

The following example defines two lists. The first is a list of available top-pings at the pizzeria, and the second is the list of toppings that the user has requested.
