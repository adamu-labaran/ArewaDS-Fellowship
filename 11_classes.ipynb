    "space.\n",
    "In mathematical notation, points are often written in parentheses with a comma separating\n",
    "the coordinates. For example, (0, 0) represents the origin, and (x, y) represents the point x\n",
    "units to the right and y units up from the origin.\n",
    "There are several ways we might represent points in Python:\n",

    "• We could store the coordinates as elements in a list or tuple.\n",
    "• We could create a new type to represent points as objects.\n",
    "Creating a new type is more complicated than the other options, but it has advantages that\n",
    "will be apparent soon.\n",

    "abstract representation of the structure of a program. Instead of showing individual objects, it shows classes and the relationships between them.\n",
    "There are several kinds of relationship between classes:\n",
    "• Objects in one class might contain references to objects in another class. For example,\n",
    "each Rectangle contains a reference to a Point, and each Deck contains references to\n",
    "many Cards. This kind of relationship is called HAS-A, as in, “a Rectangle has a\n",
    "Point.”\n",
    "• One class might inherit from another. This relationship is called IS-A, as in, “a Hand\n",
    "is a kind of a Deck.”\n",
    "• One class might depend on another in the sense that objects in one class take objects in the second class as parameters, or use objects in the second class as part of a\n",
    "computation. This kind of relationship is called a dependency.\n",

    "The star (*) near the arrow head is a multiplicity; it indicates how many Cards a Deck has.\n",
    "A multiplicity can be a simple number, like 52, a range, like 5..7 or a star, which indicates\n",

    "this method, you’ll get that version instead. This behavior is usually a good thing, but it\n",
    "can be confusing.\n",
    "Any time you are unsure about the flow of execution through your program, the simplest solution is to add print statements at the beginning of the relevant methods. If\n",
    "Deck.shuffle prints a message that says something like Running Deck.shuffle, then as\n",
    "the program runs it traces the flow of execution.\n",
    "As an alternative, you could use this function, which takes an object and a method name\n",
