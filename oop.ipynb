If the battery’s capacity is 40 kWh, get_range() sets the range to 150 miles, and if the capacity is 65 kWh, it sets the range to 225 miles. It then reports this value. When we want to use this method, we again have to call it through the car’s battery attribute 1. The output tells us the range of the car based on its battery size:"

    ">As you begin to model more complicated things like electric cars, you’ll wrestle with interesting questions. Is the range of an electric car a property of the battery or of the car? If we’re only describing one car, it’s probably fine to maintain the association of the method get_range() with the Battery class. But if we’re describing a manufacturer’s entire line of cars, we probably want to move get_range() to the ElectricCar class. \n",
    "\n",
    ">The get_range() method would still check the battery size before determining the range, but it would report a range specific to the kind of car it’s associated with. Alternatively, we could maintain the association of the get_range() method with the battery but pass it a parameter such as car_model. \n",
    "\n",
    ">The get_range() method would then report a range based on the battery size and car model. This brings you to an interesting point in your growth as a programmer. When you wrestle with questions like these, you’re thinking at a higher logical level rather than a syntax-focused level. You’re thinking not about Python, but about how to represent the real world in code. When you reach this point, you’ll realize there are often no right or wrong approaches to modeling real-world situations. Some approaches are more efficient than others, but it takes practice to find the most efficient representations. \n",
